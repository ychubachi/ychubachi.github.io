You can follow the Hugo\u0026rsquo;s Quick Start Guide for that.\nAfter you\u0026rsquo;re done with that, it\u0026rsquo;s time for installing Minimo!\nInstalling Minimo There are two different ways you can install Minimo:\n As clone As submodule  The second method is recommended.\nInstall Minimo as clone With this method, you will simply clone it. And a copy of Minimo\u0026rsquo;s repository will be stored with the rest of you site. Enter the following command for cloning Minimo:\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/MunifTanjim/minimo themes/minimo Install Minimo as submodule This method doesn\u0026rsquo;t store a copy of Minimo\u0026rsquo;s repository inside your site\u0026rsquo;s repository. Rather it adds Minimo as a dependency. Start by this command:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/MunifTanjim/minimo themes/minimo This will add Minimo\u0026rsquo;s repository as a submodule to your site\u0026rsquo;s repository. Now, you will have to pull the theme:\ngit submodule init git submodule update That\u0026rsquo;s all, Minimo is ready to be used.\nConfiguration for Minimo For getting started with Minimo, copy the config.toml file from the exampleSite directory inside Minimo\u0026rsquo;s repository to your site repository:\ncp themes/minimo/exampleSite/config.toml . You can take a look at the config.toml file of this site.\nNow, you can start editing this file and change the configuration!\nSetting up Authors Follow the Authors Setup Guide for setting up authors for you site.\nSetting up Widgets If you want to use Widgets on your site, take a look at the Widgets documentation\n Et voilà!
